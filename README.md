# HealthUp

Currently, as the world is going through a pandemic, there are few issues that common people are facing.Firstly, it has become a hassle to obtain a doctor’s appointment for any other illness apart from Covid. This is primarily because the hospitals are prioritizing Covid patients.
Secondly, plasma therapy is the most common technique currently used by doctors worldwide to treat Covid patients. This procedure requires a donor who was test Covid positive, developed anti bodies and recovered. Finding a donor is a tedious task these days and even if we find someone, the donor might not be living close to the required place or could be with a different blood group.
The goal of this project is to develop an android application that will solve both the above-mentioned concerns. “Health-up” android application will help the user to book a doctor’s appointment using a simple user interface. The user can simply filter the doctor’s availability using location and specialization. This application will have a simple interface to search for plasma donors in a particular area with a matching blood group. The user can also proactively register as a donor by simply filling a form using this application.
